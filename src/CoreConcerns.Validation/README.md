# CoreConcerns.Validation

## Overview

`CoreConcerns.Validation` is a comprehensive validation library for .NET, built on top of FluentValidation, designed to simplify the addition of complex validation logic to your applications. It extends FluentValidation with custom validation rules, making it easy to validate phone numbers, email addresses, and other common data formats.

## Features

- Validate phone numbers with country-specific formats.
- Enforce email addresses to conform to specific domains.
- Extend FluentValidation with more complex custom rules.

## Installation

Install `CoreConcerns.Validation` using NuGet:

```bash
dotnet add package CoreConcerns.Validation
```

Or via the NuGet package manager console:

```powershell
Install-Package CoreConcerns.Validation
```

## Usage

Here's how to implement custom validation for unique country phone numbers and emails with a specified domain:

```csharp
public class MyValidator : AbstractValidator<MyModel>
{
    public MyValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(x => x.PhoneNumber).NigerianPhoneNumber();
        RuleFor(x => x.Email).ValidEmailAddress("example.com");
        // Additional rules...
    }
}
```

## Examples

### Validate a Nigerian Phone Number

```csharp
public class UserValidator : AbstractValidator<User>
{
    public UserValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(user => user.PhoneNumber).NigerianPhoneNumber();
    }
}
```

### Validate an Email Address with a Specific Domain

```csharp
public class CustomerValidator : AbstractValidator<Customer>
{
    public CustomerValidator()
    {
        RuleFor(customer => customer.Email).ValidEmailAddress("mydomain.com");
    }
}
```
